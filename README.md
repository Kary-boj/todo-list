# To-Do List App

## Overview
This is a **To-Do List Application** that allows users to add, edit, remove, and mark tasks as completed. Completed tasks move to the **Completed Tasks** page (`index4.html`), while uncompleted tasks return to the **Pending Tasks** page (`index5.html`).

## Features
- **Add New Tasks**: Users can input tasks and add them to the list.
- **Mark Tasks as Completed**: Clicking the star icon turns it green, changes the background of the task, and moves it to the Completed Tasks page.
- **Unmark Tasks as Completed**: Clicking a green star turns it back to default, resets the background, and moves the task to the Pending Tasks page.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can modify task descriptions.
- **Remove Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list.
- **Persistent Task Management**: Ensures tasks remain when switching between completed and uncompleted lists.
